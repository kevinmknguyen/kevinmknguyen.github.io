Here are some cool projects that I've worked on in the past:

- [BlindBot](https://github.com/HyperCricket/visual_occlusion): My first serious **research** project that dove into looking for objects (blocks) under scene-based partial observability. The purpose of this was to test how well Diffusion Policy worked under scene-based partial observability, since Diffusion Policy hasn't been rigourously tested before. Conducted research via Robosuite, Python, and a lot of prompt engineering. Paper for this project can be found [here]({{ '/assets/files/FRI_II___Final_Paper.pdf' | relative_url }}).
